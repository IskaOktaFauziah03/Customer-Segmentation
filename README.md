This project about customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Machine Learning). Objective of this project is to know the segmentation of customer based on their behaviors and to make the best strategy for each cluster. Some data pre-processing are filtering dataset (only use transactions from three countries), doing data cleaning, creating dataset RFM for modelling, and doing data calling. After analyzing the data using Elbow Method, it is resulted the best K value for K-Means Clustering is K = 5. Therefore, the result of this segmentation is there are five clustering. For certain reason, the clustering is reduced become four clustering.
